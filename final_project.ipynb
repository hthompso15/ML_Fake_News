partisans explain to those of us who support bernie sanders just how naive we are only hillary we are told has a real shot at\\u00a0winning in november shes the only one with a realistic grasp of how washington works whose moderate and modest policy aims might realistically be enacted it often sounds as if clintons central pitch to voters isnt that she has a moral vision for the country but that she owns the franchise on realism\\n\\nbernie meanwhile is just a sweetshouting rube whose quartercentury as a congressman and senator has somehow failed to instill in him an appreciation for the twin plagues of grift and gridlock\\n\\nfor us benighted hippies the standard counterargument at this point is that our man understands all too well the magnitude of washingtons dysfunction which is why hes calling for a political revolution to obliterate the most heinous aspects of the status quo starting with corporatesponsored elections\\n\\ni happen to agree with this but theres a sadder and more pointed response to hillarys reality brigade namely that they need to face the reality of what the 2016 election is going to be like with hillary at the top of the ticket\\n\\nbefore i outline that particular shitstorm let me issue a few suretobeignored and therefore pointless caveats first i myself was a hillary supporter until sanders entered the race more precisely until i read his policy positions\\n\\nsecond i will enthusiastically support hillary when and if she is nominated years ago i interviewed the secretary and i say now what i said then she is a brilliant and compassionate public servant if presidential elections in this country were based on policy positions and moral intention on how each candidate hopes to solve common crises of state clinton would win going away\\n\\nalas the reality is that hillary is among the most hated politicians in america there is to begin with her dismal favorability rating which stands at 53 percent with a net negative of 12\\u00a0percent sanders has a net positive of 12\\u00a0percent\\n\\nbut even more important is\\u00a0the intensity of the animus against her and the sad mountain of baggage she carries with her as a candidate\\n\\nno matter who the gop nominee is the battle plan against hillary will be the same a tawdry and unrelenting relitigation of all the phony scandals cooked up by the vast rightwing conspiracy that she identified nearly two decades ago\\n\\ncue up the pearl jam folks because were going all the way back to the 90s whitewater travelgate troopergate lewinskygate with a little vince foster murdergate for a dash of blood but waitthose are just the golden oldies youll also be hearing about the clinton foundation and the clinton pardons of course what respectable slander campaign would be complete without the new material benghazi the private email server the wall street speeches\\n\\nthe dark corporate money and talented propagandists aligned against hillary will make the swift boat veterans look like toy soldiers\\n\\nand because our fourth estate is driven at this point almost entirely by the desperate promotion of scandal narratives and conflict every one of these paid attacks will be amplified by socalled free media or what us starryeyed hippies used to call journalism\\n\\nim not blaming hillary for this sad state of affairs im just trying to bewhats the word im looking for ah yes here it isrealistic about how its going to go down republicans tend to lose when they have to talk in specific terms about policies priorities and solutions they win when elections are reduced to brawls andor personality contests see reagancarter bushkerry et al but if donald trump is the nominee as seems most likely right now he will also enjoy two genuine lines of attack against hillary the first is the same one bernie just used to upset her in michigan the fact that free trade pacts are wildly unpopular with many americans trump has been fullthroated and as usual somewhat full of shit in his condemnation of free trade and it has been one of his most successful pitches you can bet your bottom yen that hell hammer hillary on this as if she personally whipped votes for nafta hell excoriate various forms of crony capitalism deals cut with big pharma bogus military contracts etc that democrats such as hillary either endorsed or enabled through timidity and hell blast her for backing our trilliondollar boondoggle in iraq too these accusations will be framed in terms of a larger narrative that hillary represents business as usual in washington that shes just another career pol beholden to the donor class and to the wall street swells who paid her millions to deliver her secret speeches trump may be a sexually insecure adolescent with a penchant for inciting racial violence but the one undeniable aspect of his appeal is that he recognizes the toxic nature of the status quo and will by sheer force of personality bring it down this promise is about as flimsy as a trump university diploma but its resonating with voters who feel washingtons carnival of corruption is beyond redemption all of which brings us back to that credulous waif from brooklyn by way of ben and jerrys donald trump can holler all he wants about how crazy bernie is a socialist but he and the super pacs wont be able to distract voters by digging up scandals in his past nor will trump be able to portray him as a corporate stooge in fact the shocking success of the sanders campaign is predicated on many of the same essential frustrations trump is exploiting corporate influence wage stagnation trade this is why polls consistently show sanders beating trump more convincingly than clinton does the right wing knows how to go after hillary because theyve been doing so for 30\\u00a0years within the media and a significant portion of the electorate the neural pathways have already been carved out hillary is defensive programmed ethically suspect they are going to have a more difficult time smearing a candidate whose biggest liabilities are his extreme policy positions most of which sound more like a common sense corrective to the excesses of capitalism higher taxes on corporations and the superwealthy healthcare as a right a higher minimum wage increased funding for education and infrastructure good luck demonizing those positions big donald none of this is to suggest that hillary wont beat trump if they wind up as the nominees nor that she wont be a great president but if hillary supporters want to claim the mantle of realism they should start by accepting very real liabilities of their candidate\",\n          \"governor tells citizens to leave statewho the heck voted this guy in as governor his constituents should be his first priority if you haven t heard minnesota s muslims have been a problem from the beginning here s a video to fill you in on just how much they don t want to assimilate sharia for everyone governor mark dayton took advantage of a st cloud naacp community conversation to express his feelings toward constituents who would rather live in minnesota than in new somalia look around you this is minnesota  dayton said  minnesota is not like it was 30 50 years ago   this is minnesota and you have every right to be here and anybody who cannot accept your right to be here and this is minnesota should find another state minnesota isn t what it was like 5 years ago the government is displacing the population with unskilled muslims from africa at a blitzkrieg paceapparently some minnesotans who have to pick up the tab for the welfare colonists don t appreciate having their state given away to the modern equivalent of a conquering army dayton s message to them is clear if you are that intolerant if you are that much of a racist or a bigot then find another state find a state where the minority population is 1 percent or whatever it s not that in minnesota it s not going to be again  governor dayton in the past most people would fight to the death to prevent their society from being invaded and destroyed by a hostile and utterly alien foreign culture but liberals are sure that if they just brandish the word  racist  citizens will meekly cringe and cowerunsurprisingly the hamasaffiliated islamic advocacy group cair was presentcair minnesota executive director jaylani hussein who had previously addressed the crowd on his concerns on racial tension said his organization is not affiliated with terrorist groupsthis of course is a brazen lie but it hardly matters thanks to the participation of our treasonous ruling class hijrah has become a more effective form of jihad than terrorismit could not be more obvious that our liberal rulers are as hostile as they are arrogant toward the people they supposedly represent they are deliberately destroying our society through the massive importation of largely unassimilable and governmentdependent immigrants from the third

megaselling queens of pop whose every move reverberates throughout the culture the fact that they will face off in each of the top three categories     album record and song of the year     gives the grammys a rare tension that can only be good for ratings yet their competition is also fraught in ways that have long dogged the awards one concerns race a subject the grammys have a tangled history with     especially this year when one of the most acclaimed young black artists frank ocean has boycotted the process altogether another sensitive area is the grammys spotty record in recognizing the vanguards of contemporary pop added to the mix is a heightened political climate in which issues of race and identity are front and center raising the question of whether the music industry will use this years grammys as a soapbox many longtime grammy watchers say that a sweep by adele     and therefore a beyonc\\u00e9 snub     could feed into   complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories ebro darden a disc jockey on the new york   station hot 97 and on apples beats 1 said that a big beyonc\\u00e9 win would be the best move for the grammys if they want to get the most attention and keep people interested  should adele dominate he added some music fans would come for them and say #oscarssowhite  with the news media closely focused on diversity at awards shows     and the public relations nightmares that result from an absence of it     that would be an unwelcome response for the recording academy the organization behind the grammys a representative for the academy declined to comment adele and beyonc\\u00e9 are both hailed in music circles as supremely deserving talents but for voters the singers also represent a choice between two strains of modern pop adeles album 25 and her hit ballad hello are examples of the finely   traditional style that is grammy catnip beyonc\\u00e9s lemonade with its dynamic single formation and accompanying politically and racially charged hourlong art film represents an edgier    sound that rarely takes the top prize     exhibit a for those who contend that the grammys are perennially out of touch beyonc\\u00e9s own example is telling she may already have 20 grammys on her shelf but only one is in the   big four categories album record and song of the year or best new artist she has also been passed over twice for album of the year losing to taylor swift in 2010 and beck in 2015 much to the consternation of kanye west a frequent grammy critic the #oscarssowhite controversy really shook the motion picture academy and i think the grammys are saying there but for the grace of god go we so lets make sure this doesnt happen to us said paul grein a former billboard columnist who performs detailed grammy analysis for the industry magazine hits the grammys may be more diverse than most shows this year beyonc\\u00e9 is the top nominee with nine nods while the newcomer chance the rapper has seven but the shows record in recognizing black talent has come under plenty of fire mr ocean declined to submit his work for consideration in this years grammys at all saying that the institution just doesnt seem to be representing very well for people who come from where i come from and calling the boycott his colin kaepernick moment  rap fans were outraged when kendrick lamar lost best rap album to the white rapper macklemore in 2014 though mr lamar took all four rap trophies last year eminem has won best rap album six times the last black artists to win album of the year were legacy picks ray charles in 2005 and herbie hancock covering joni mitchell in 2008 a black woman hasnt won since lauryn hill did nearly two decades ago russell simmons the entertainment mogul who is a founder of def jam recordings said that beyonc\\u00e9 is overdue for being accepted by the mainstream in the way she deserves  shes obviously the most mainstream thing on the planet mr simmons said he added when they define her her color has something to do with the way shes viewed and the amount of awards she wins and the accolades she gets i would venture to say were she white and blond from texas she would be recognized differently  some however reject the idea of the   contest as a referendum on race i dont think its a black and white thing its a quality thing said joel peresman the chief executive of the rock and roll hall of fame foundation kevin liles a veteran record executive now with 300 entertainment said that the grammys had evolved in recent years if it was truly a dormant or stagnant association then beyonc\\u00e9 wouldnt be there all shapes sizes colors and genres are represented  the odds on adele and beyonc\\u00e9 are hard to read even among industry insiders adele may be a safe choice but she also swept all three top prizes five years ago making a repeat seem unlikely no   or contemporary rb album has won the top prize since outkasts   love below in 2004 a tough precedent for beyonc\\u00e9 on the other hand there is a wide sense in the industry that it may simply be her turn at the grammys however anything is possible contenders for an upset album of the year winner are streaming hits like drakes views and justin biebers purpose and this years darkest horse a sailors guide to earth by the country outsider sturgill simpson the awards   also comes at a cultural crossroads following a divisive presidential election now even the most mainstream events are weighted with ideological expectations the gloves are off it is absolutely in style to have a political opinion right now the d j mr darden said predicting that the grammys would absolutely have that moment where current events come up such as with meryl streeps golden globes speech aimed at president trump lady gaga a vocal hillary clinton supporter did not make a grand political statement as some had hoped at the super bowl but she will have another platform when she performs with metallica at the grammys among the other performers scheduled on sunday are katy perry who was a dedicated surrogate for mrs clinton and chance the rapper a frequent guest of president obamas white house beyonc\\u00e9 and adele who is british both expressed support for mrs clinton last year we want to be a place where artists can feel they can come and express themselves ken ehrlich the grammys producer said of the possibility that performances or speeches could become political our guidelines are taste and the f c c the f c c is more concerned with profanity than it is with political discourse  mr simmons said that no matter who comes away the nights big winner a foray by a major artist into politics would be a boon for the show if trump says the grammys are overrated on monday morning people will go looking for what hes talking about mr simmons said i hope he does \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
